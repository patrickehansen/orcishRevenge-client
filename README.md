# orcishRevent-client
Orcish Revenge is a homebrew table top RPG game. This project is an attempt to bring that tabletop experience into its own web app.
Roll20 is probably the best analog to what this project will present. A canvas element will be the core game board, with a number of smaller
components to facilitate game play.

This repository is the front end client, intended to be compiled down by webpack and served statically by the server.
